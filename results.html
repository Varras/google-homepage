                        Theres an idea thats been gaining ground in the tech community lately: Everyone should learn to code. 
                        But heres the problem with that idea: Coding is not the new literacy. 
                        If you regularly pay attention to the cultural shenanigans of Silicon Valley,
                         youve no doubt heard of the Learn to Code movement. You really did just get Rick Rolled!
